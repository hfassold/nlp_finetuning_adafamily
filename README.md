# Transformer model Fine-tuning for text classification with 'AdaFamily' optimizer and 'mini-batch trimming'

Demonstrates finetuning of a NLP model with novel 'AdaFamily' optimizer and 'mini-batch trimming'.
Code is taken and adapted from https://github.com/hfwittmann/transformer_finetuning_lightning
Uses pytorch lightning. Demonstrates also how to modify a huggingface transformer model so that it employs a _custom_ loss function.
